# agentDVRAidetections
Displays the ai Detections from AgentDVR without running the whole client.


Was troubleshooting agent dvr ai detections and wanted to be able to capture the good and bad detections without the overhead of the whole client runing in my browser. 

Ive since decided to move to doing this at the codeproject ai instead. but uploaded it for historic reasons. i might want to revist this later or even send myself the images through messenger or something
